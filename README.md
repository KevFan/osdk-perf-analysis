# Operator SDK Performance Analysis
This repository provides a Ginkgo test suite and Jupyter Notebook
to analyze the performance of the sample Memcached Operators provided by Operator SDK.

The project's goal was to determine any performance differences between the Ansible, Go, and Helm-based project types using 
the provided samples and determining possible limiting factors of the abstraction layer for the Ansible and Helm-based Operator.
